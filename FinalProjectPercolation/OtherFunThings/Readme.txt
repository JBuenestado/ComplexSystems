This script called "sidethings.cpp" was the original script used to check for percolations. It is unoptimised and very full of legacy code, however, it allows us to generate for visual files, like the gifs representations or other types of forms for the OG matrix.

For results, use main.cpp
To check for fun things, try changing the size of a matrix, percolation percentage or else, use this script, but is not part of the project anymore.

To represent the gifs a generic python script was used.
